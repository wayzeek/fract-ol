## I Introduction

Fractals, invented by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1974, are mathematical objects whose structure remains invariant at different scales. They appear in many natural phenomena and can be generated by mathematical algorithms. This project invites you to explore the creation of graphical fractals.

## II Objectives

This project allows you to discover graphic programming using the MiniLibX library. You will deal with complex numbers, graphic programming optimization, and event management.

## III Common Rules

- Your project must be written in C.
- Your project must comply with the Norm.
- Your functions should not stop unexpectedly.
- Any memory allocated on the heap must be freed.
- You must provide a Makefile that compiles your sources.
- If the project allows your libft, you must copy its sources and its associated Makefile into a libft folder.

## IV Mandatory Part

### IV.1 Rendering

- Your program must offer the Julia and Mandelbrot sets.
- The mouse wheel must allow zooming in and out.
- At least one parameter is passed in the command line to define the type of fractal.
- There must be a minimum color palette to feel the depth of each fractal.

### IV.2 Graphic Management

- Your program must display an image in a window.
- Window management must remain fluid.
- Pressing the ESC key should close the window and quit the program properly.
- Using MiniLibX images is mandatory.
